To run the test programs you will need to set the paths to find the library\-:

``` export L\-D\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B\-R\-A\-R\-Y\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H=\$\-L\-D\-\_\-\-L\-I\-B\-R\-A\-R\-Y\-\_\-\-P\-A\-T\-H\-:./lib ```

Then run the test programs as follows\-:

``` ./grader ```

Or the run.\-sh script will set the path for you and execute valgrind\-:

``` ./run.sh ```

To run the autograder before submitting, run\-:

``` ./backpack.sh ```
