Question responses:
1 & 2. 
Goals include making separate functions for individual coding tasks, for example smash_get_input gets the input from the user. Another add-on was to create a history storage system, with several sub-routines that involved initializing the history fuction, adding to history, clearing history, and printing the history to the user. 

3. 
Readability: 2 Everything is indented perfectly, and variables are named "easy to understand".

Structure: 2 Looks pretty good. Everyone has to follow the same structure for this assignment, and the student followed it to his best abilities of keeping it structured nicely. 

Testing: 2 This part would usually be a 1, but the student.. went above and beyond by having his own test file already finished and working.
