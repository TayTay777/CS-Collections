Q: 1.8

  Q: How accurate is this sort of dependence managment?
  A: That depends on how well you make the make file pertaining to what is being compiled in the make file. 
      Make files can be really complicated, but there is almost always to tool to compensate. If not properly 
      made, the make file can be very unaccurate. 

  Q: Under what circumstances will it lead to unnecessary work?
  A: If the program is viewed, then saved. This changes the timestamp for the program which is what 
      make uses to check if anything has been changed. If the timestamp is different make will recompile
      files that haven't been changed. 
  
  Q: Under what circumstances will it fail to recompile something that needs to be recompiled?
  A: If the header file is changed, then the C files that the header file is getting its code from 
      need to be recompiled. By default this does not happen unless a DEPS = headerfile.h rule is made. 
      So, if that rule is not within the make file, and the header file is changed. Running make will 
      not effectively compile the program suite effectively.
