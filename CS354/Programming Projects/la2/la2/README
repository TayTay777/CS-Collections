This program suite allows a user to create a checking and/or savings account. The user also gets to set their own made up values that go into the virtual checking and savings account. 

The checking/savings accounts take in an account number, customer value (which is simply a name), and an initial balance. 

Money can be withdrawn and added to these accounts as well (examples at the bottom of the Bank.st file)

## Getting Started & Running

To get started set your values within the Bank.st file (COMMENT: indicate where to enter in fields within the file, at the bottom)

after entering your values, compile the program suite in this specific order:

[User@computer]$ gst Customer.st Account.st CheckingAccount.st SavingsAccount.st Bank.st

### Prerequisites
