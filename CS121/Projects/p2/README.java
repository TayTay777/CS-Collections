OVERVIEW:

This program is used to find the 4 nearest parking spots from a random location.
 * It gives you the cost of your parking duration input 
 * and the distance to the parking spot


INCLUDED FILES:

FindParking.java
ParkingSpot.java
README.java

COMPILING AND RUNNING:

To run the program go to the directory troberts/Home/workspace/p2
in the console, type javac FindParking.java
then type java FindParking

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

This program is designed to give you four open parking spots that are generated in random locations. 
Your cars initial position is random as well. 

Additionally, the program informs you of the distance from your car to the four open parking 
spots as well as the cost for the duration you plan to park there. 

When starting the program, you will be asked for a rand seed to generate static
random variables for all positions.

Additionally, you will be asked for your planned duration of parking. 

TESTING:

Testing included entering the same random seeds as the example provided.
The results where the exact same as the examples. 

As long as ONLY NUMBERS are entered, there is no errors.


DISCUSSION:

I had issues understanding how the charge object worked in relation to the 
parking spot variables that I created. With help, I was able to get it working,
but would still like to know how it is constructed.
