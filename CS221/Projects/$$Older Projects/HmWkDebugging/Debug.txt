 1. Found a Runtime error for the testIsEmpty method for the first set. 
 Changed the method's < sign to == because rear is initialized at 0 to begin with. 
 
 2. Second Runtime error occured with the add method in the ArraySet.java doc. The array "set" 
 needed another placeholder for the next int added to the array. added "rear++" at the 
 end of the nested if statement. 
 
 3. Third error occured because the remove method in the ArraySet class was trying to copy an empty 
 element. This empty space was the rear, as shown in the .add method. Stopped the nested while loop 
 by changing (i < rear) to (i < rear-1)
